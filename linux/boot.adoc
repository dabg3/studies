= Booting Process 

== Stage 1: Bios
Power-on event initializes the program counter of CPU. +
The _BIOS_ residing on the read only memory (ROM) is executed from the particular 
memory address in program counter. +

Tasks::

. Initial code execution

Typically, the first few sectors of the first found selected device (hard disk, floppy disk, 
CD-ROM, â€¦) are loaded to the memory and this initial code is executed.
The _initial code_ can be:

* The bootloader code
* The kernel code of the stepping stone OS such as FreeDOS
* The kernel code of the target OS if it fits in this small space 

== Stage 2: Bootloader

The _bootloader_ loads the system kernel image and the initrd image to the memory and 
hands control over to them. +
The _initrd_ image is the root filesystem image and its support 
depends on the bootloader used.

NOTE: The initrd image for the 2.6 Linux kernel is technically the _initramfs_ 
(initial RAM filesystem) image. +
The _initramfs_ image is a gzipped cpio archive of files in the root filesystem.

== sed

*sed* is a non-interactive stream editor.

By default sed *prints all processed input to standard output* (except input that has been 
modified/deleted by commands such as `d`). 

* `-n` to suppress output
* `-i` to edit files in-place instead of printing to standard output
* `p` command to print specific lines
[source,sh]
----
# prints only line 45 of the input file
sed -n ’45p’ file.txt
----
See also the `W` and `s///w` commands for writing output to other files.

A _sed program_ consists of one or more sed commands, passed in by one or more of the `-e`,
`-f`, `--expression`, and `--file` options, or the first non-option argument if zero of these
options are used

sed commands follow this syntax: `[addr]X[options]`

* `[addr]` can be a single line number, a regular expression, or a range of lines. 
* `X` is a single letter sed command executed on all lines matched by `[addr]`
